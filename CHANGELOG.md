#### 1.10.0 - 2017-04-20
*  Added config option for useCookieStorage to allow use of either cookies or localStorage. By default, localStorage is used (useCookieStorage = false). If localStorage not available, reverts to cookie use.

#### 1.9.0 - 2017-04-17
*  Fixed bug where calling setUserIdentity with a similar type added another identity, rather than replacing the identity.
*  Calling setUserIdentity with `id = null` and valid type will remove the user identity of that type.
*  Include CommerceEvent custom attributions in expansion; makes a copy of the original commerce event rather than referencing it, which would mutate it.
